Task 0:
I have used index of list to find the required elements.
So, Time Complexity is O(1).

Task 1:
I have used simple loops to add the numbers into a set.
so, Time Complexity is O(n).

Task 2:
I have used some simple and nested loops and in-built functions to execute the program.
So, Time Complexity is O(n^2).

Task 3:
I have used simple loops to iterate over the numbers and used list.sort() function for sorting the list.
So, Time Complexity is O(n log(n)).

Task 4:
I have used simple loops to iterate over the numbers and used list.sort() function for sorting the list.
So, Time Complexity is O(n log(n)).
